# Real-Estate-Property-Listing #

The application is a robust platform designed to simplify property search and management. 
- the code follows a clean architecture pattern, separating concerns into distinct layers such as Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure. This promotes modularity, testability, and scalability of our system
- we are also adopting CQRS principles, we separate read and write operations, allowing us to optimize our system for different use cases and improve performance.
- MediatR and Mediator Pattern: simplified the communication flow within the application; components don't need to know about each other's implementations, reducing dependencies and making the code more flexible
